I work primarily with web applications, focusing on front-end and full-stack development.
My interests are scalable architectures, well-structured systems, and interfaces that
prioritize clarity and correctness over novelty.

Currently working with TypeScript, React, and serverless architectures, often in
SaaS and B2B contexts.
